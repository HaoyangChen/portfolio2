## Haoyang Chen's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a junior graduating in June, 2021 with a B.S in Informatics and a focus on Information Architecture at the University of Washington. This portfolio used Gulp based development environment with a watch task and was built using SASS and Bootstrap framework. 
You can visit the live site by clicking [here](https://haoyangchen.github.io/portfolio/) or copy this link https://haoyangchen.github.io/portfolio/ and open it in a browser. 

#### Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp watch` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
- `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
- `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have npm installed globally in order to use this build environment.
